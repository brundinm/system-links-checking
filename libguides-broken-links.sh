# Purpose: Shell script to process LibGuides content to identify any broken
# links

# Description: Bash shell script to first run LinkChecker to process the
# LibGuides guide URLs obtained from the XML sitemap to output a file of
# broken links, and then post process the broken links output file to form a
# broken links report in a CSV tab-delimited format.  Then use a LibGuides
# mappings file to run an operation to add a new field to the broken links
# report that contains the guide name for each broken link record.

# To run the script, type the following at the command prompt:

#     bash libguides-broken-links.sh

# Notes:
# (1) In addition to the standard Unix utilities, this script requires that
# LinkChecker (https://linkchecker.github.io/linkchecker/) be installed.
# (2) You need to put the "libguides-mappings.tsv" mappings file in the same
# directory as this "libguides-broken-links.sh" script file; this mappings file
# is a helper file that is used to provide the guide name of the parent page
# that contains the broken link.  Over time, you can periodically check to see
# if the "libguides-broken-links.tsv" mappings file needs to be revised by
# reviewing both the subject guides page at
# "https://libguides.macewan.ca/" and the XML sitemap page at
# "https://libguides.macewan.ca/sitemap.xml" -- there are currently 72
# published guides that are listed in the mappings file.
# (3) The LibGuides broken links tab-delimited file
# "libguides-broken-links.csv" from the script output can be either pasted or
# imported into an Excel spreadsheet, and then sorted and styled as desired.
# (4) The LinkChecker command is formulated to log only errors, but you can
# change the "--no-warnings" option to "--verbose" to log all links, which
# include valid, warnings, and errors links; removing the "--no-warnings"
# option will log both errors and warnings.
# (5) The types of HTTP status code errors in column 4 "result" of the
# "dspace-broken-links.csv" file that reliably tend to indicate a broken
# link include 404 (404, 404 Not found, 404 OK, 404 Page not found: [. . .],
# 404 The requested content does not exist, 404 Unknown site), 409 (409
# Conflict), 410 (410 Gone), and 500 (500 Internal Server Error).  Other error
# messages that usually indicate a broken link are ConnectionError:
# HTTPConnectionPool [. . .], ConnectTimeout: HTTPConnectionPool [. . .],
# SSLError: HTTPSConnectionPool [. . .], and URL host '[. . .]' has invalid
# port.

# Function to check for broken links in the LibGuides published guides.  Use
# the LinkChecker link validator to check the links in LibGuides guides using
# the XML sitemap located at "https://libguides.macewan.ca/sitemap.xml" to
# identify any broken links in each guide and write out to the CSV file
# "broken-links.csv".  Then post process the "broken-links.csv" file to create
# a valid CSV file by removing newline characters that are not at the end of a
# record, deleting comment lines, and changing the field delimiters from
# semicolons to tabs to facilitate easier pasting of the output data into a
# Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.

    # script directory, and if it does not exist, display a warning message
